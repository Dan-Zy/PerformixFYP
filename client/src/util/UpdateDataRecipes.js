There is really no hard and fast rule for the consistency of the congee, it really depends on personal preferences, add more or less rice according to desire.Once you have achieved the consistency you desire, drop the marinated prawns in and watch closely.I only boiled the prawns for about 2-3 minutes to ensure that they didn't get overcooked - remember that the prawns will continue to 'cook' in the hot congee even after the heat is turned off.Ladle into individual bowls, and add as much green onions, ginger as you like - add dashes of soy, sesame oil and white pepper to your liking. Congee to me is best served piping, tongue-burningly hot!"

You can find the original and all my other recipes here: http://sallycooks.com/2013/11/23/cauliflower-mash-with-roasted-garlic/  This one comes from one of my favorite pages in the magazine titled \u201cMashed Vegetables 10 ways\u201d The pages are filled with brightly colored mashed vegetables including beets, celery root and rutabagas.  I\u2019ve been meaning to try mashed cauliflower after seeing it make the rounds on Pinterest for some time so I gave it a whirl in my food processor (pun intended) and found it to be pretty delicious!  It would be a great side dish in place of traditional mashed potatoes this Thanksgiving.I added roasted garlic to the recipe to give the cauliflower mash a richer flavor.  It\u2019s easy to roast garlic in a few steps.Simply preheat your oven to 400 degrees, peel off the outer layers of the garlic bulb skin, leaving the skins of the individual cloves intact. Using a knife, cut off the top of cloves, exposing the individual cloves of garlic."
